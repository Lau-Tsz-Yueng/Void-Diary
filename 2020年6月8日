just like democracy, free speech is founded on the generous but sometimes naïve hope/ belief that humans are capable of using it responsibly and with decency. I personally believe that making a joke about an important issue in a casual conversation doesn’t mean it’s a reflection about how you’d handle that same issue in a more serious/ pragmatic situation. Free speech also means that other people are allowed to have whatever opinion they want about you or your joke, whether you think it’s justified or not. That’s their right to free speech too. Some people will find certain jokes funny while others might be disgusted - that’s okay. While you are legally allowed to make jokes about whatever you want (although hate speech laws seem to be gaining a worrying amount of control on this front), you’ll soon find that you’re gonna piss people off if you keep repeating jokes to them that they dislike. You’ll probably lose friends if you do that, or screw up your chances of making friends. If you care a lot about your right to make jokes about whatever you want then fair enough, but you can’t expect everyone you meet to like you as a person as well. People have feelings and if you continually hurt them they will not want to and don’t have to socialise with you. I make jokes about any subject under the sun with some friends and then refrain from bringing up certain topics when I’m around other friends, because I care about them and respect their feelings. Your speech has consequences and you have to use it in a responsible way if you want people to respect you - if that is what you want. Free speech is a double edged sword because while it has the power to inflict suffering on other people, it is also the most useful tool we have for finding ways to alleviate and prevent suffering as well.
